# Notes on installing alternative OSes on Chromebooks

Tested on Dell Chromebook 3100, with MrChromebox's RW_LEGACY flashed via SH1MMER. Proxying on the edge part 2 eta son, just need to get to writing it.

## Windows 11

- Used tiny11 b1 iso
- Got to winPE, trackpad did not work. USB mouse did though.
- Couldn't start installation, complained about missing disk drivers

## Fedora 38 Workstation

- Booted and installed fine
- All devices seem to work well (trackpad, kb, wifi, bt)
- Best to install to stateful partition. Storage size is good enoughâ„¢, also allows you to go back to crOS via recovery usb.
- Stable enough to daily drive
